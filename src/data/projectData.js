      "The project leverages basicScroll.js to drive a truckâ€™s horizontal movement across a canvas-rendered backdrop. As users scroll, the truck progresses, and its wheels, designed as individual React components, rotate. A checkbox allows users to switch the backdrop between a cloud-filled sky and a starry night, both created using HTML canvas. All animations are encapsulated within a React framework, promoting component reusability and a structured codebase. This initiative showcases the effective union of scroll-driven events with web animations.",

Instead of relying on out-of-the-box solutions, I took the challenge to build a video player from scratch to understand the intricacies and nuances of media playback in web browsers.`,
